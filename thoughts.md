Takeaways:
1. Communication is the top priority when working in a team.
2. When coding something that is complex, you should write out the pseudocode
before writing the actual code so you understand what your program is doing at
the roots and you won't have as many logic errors.

Strategies that I will use:
1. I will use the methods taught to me in the Session 1 HW about using Google
effectively.
2. I will use Git as much as I can so in the future I won't have to redo any code.

Shoutout:
1. I want to give a shoutout to all the members in Mod 0. The ones I worked with
were really nice and had great communication in the breakout activities.
